⛵️ smee: k8s kubeconfig file manager
====================================

CLI tool that allows you to manage your kubeconfig files, listing, adding,
unsetting and setting which one should [kubectl][1] use.

Why smee? Keeping with the nautical theme of Kubernetes, Smee is the second
hand for Capitan Hook in Peter Pan.

Wait, isn't using rust a bit of an overkill for this? Yes.
Couldn't this just be a simple bash script? Also yes.
Could this just be a some aliases in your .bashrc file? Of course.
